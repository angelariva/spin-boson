# Spin-Boson data visualization

The data is produced using Tensor Network Simulations of the Dynamics at Finite Temperature of the Spin-Boson Model for Sub-Ohmic, Ohmic and Super-Ohmic Spectral Density Functions with T-TEDOPA chain mapping. The software is from the Julia package `MPSDynamics.jl`, available [here](https://github.com/angusdunnett/MPSDynamics). The data analysis is in Python.
